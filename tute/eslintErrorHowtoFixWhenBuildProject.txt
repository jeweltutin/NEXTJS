// How can I fix this violation of this 'react/no-unescaped-entitie' of an ESLint rule?

I had the same issue with next.js. I opened the .eslintrc.json and added the following:

{
  "rules": { "react/no-unescaped-entities": 0 }
}
Now my .eslintrc.json will look as follows:

{
  "extends": "next/core-web-vitals",
  "rules": { "react/no-unescaped-entities": 0 }
}
